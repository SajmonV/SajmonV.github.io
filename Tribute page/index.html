                    Even though Winston did not have a close relationship with him,
                    he worries that he, too, will die young and decides that he will do as much with his life as he can.

                    Joseph Stalin at the Yalta Conference to discuss the organization of Europe after the war. One of
                    the controversial decisions at the conference was to allow Germany to be divided into communist and
                    non-communist, which will contribute to the tension of the Cold War.

                    as their primary concern and believe that Atlee was better equipped to lead the nation on these

                    Europe. He refers to Stalin's plan to spread communism across Europe and the term "iron curtain"
                    becomes part of political vocabulary.
